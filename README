A simple scraper/cacher for EVE Online data. It was created to pull skill and standing data for several characters and cache them locally in csv format where Google Docs can find them.

Setup: Rename key.php.dist to key.php, and refresh its value with a new randomly-generated md5.

Base
====
input.php: takes GET arguments key, charNames, apiKeys and userNames, each of which should be a comma-delimited list. It will look up userIDs, then add any new users to characters.txt.

scripts.php: parses characters.txt and runs specified scripts.

characters.txt: This file contains character API data, encrypted by a key.

Scripts
=======
skills.php: pulls the skill tree, as well as character sheets of all users in characters.txt, and generates csv.
standings.php: pulls character standings, generates csv.
